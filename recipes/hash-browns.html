        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These classic diner-style hash browns are crispy 
        on the outside and fluffy on the inside.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 peeled russet potatoes</li>
            <li>3 tabelspoons of clarified butter</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Ground pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Pinch of paprika</li>
            <li>Pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Shred potatoes into a large bowl filled with cold 
            water. Stir until water is cloudy, drain, and cover 
            potatoes again with fresh cold water. Stir again to 
            dissolve excess starch. Drain potatoes well, pat dry 
            with paper towels, and squeeze out any excess moisture.</li>
            <li>Heat clarified butter in a large non-stick pan 
            over medium heat. Sprinkle shredded potatoes into the 
            hot butter and season with salt, black pepper, cayenne 
            pepper, and paprika.</li>
            <li>Cook potatoes until a brown crust forms on the bottom, 
            about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until potatoes 
            are browned all over, about 5 more minutes.</li>
        </ol>
